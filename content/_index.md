Welcome to Nick Fisher's Tech Blog! I sometimes write in here about software engineering. Most of the older topics are "how to" articles detailing how to solve specific tasks in distributed systems that need to scale.

I still work as an engineer--writing in here has slowed with a few young kids at home &#128512;
