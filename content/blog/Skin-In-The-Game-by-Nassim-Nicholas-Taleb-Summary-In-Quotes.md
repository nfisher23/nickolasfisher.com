The topic of this summary in quotes is [Skin In the Game](https://www.amazon.com/Skin-Game-Hidden-Asymmetries-Daily/dp/042528462X). The book's central argument is that people who don't participate in both the downside and upside of something don't know what they are talking about. Simply put, if you haven't been chastised for failure in the real world and promoted for excellence in that same real world, then you will fail to actually know how the real world works.

> "It is not easy to sell without some strong narrative. But for a real business, as opposed to a fundraising scheme, something that should survive on its own, business plans and funding work backward."

> "...the error continues because someone else is paying the price."

> "The main theological flaw in Pascal's wager is that belief cannot be a free option. It entails a symmetry between what you pay and what you receive."

> "To make money, you must first survive." -Warren Buffet
