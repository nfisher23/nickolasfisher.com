The topic of this summary in quotes is [Skin In the Game](https://www.amazon.com/Skin-Game-Hidden-Asymmetries-Daily/dp/042528462X). The book&#39;s central argument is that people who don&#39;t participate in both the downside and upside of something don&#39;t know what they are talking about. Simply put, if you haven&#39;t been chastised for failure in the real world and promoted for excellence in that same real world, then you will fail to actually know how the real world works.

&gt; &#34;What is crucial here is that the downside doesn&#39;t affect the interventionist. He continues his practice from the comfort of his thermally regulated Suburban House with the two car garage, a dog, and a small play area with pesticide-free grass for his overprotected 2.2 children.&#34;

&gt; &#34;It is easier to know when something is wrong than to find the fix. Actions that remove are more robust than those that add, because addition may have unforeseen complicated feedback loops.&#34;

&gt; &#34;Skin in the game keeps human hubris in check&#34;

&gt; &#34;You do not want to win an argument--you want to win&#34;

&gt; &#34;Forecasting in words bears no relation to speculating in deeds&#34;

&gt; &#34;Freedom is always associated with risk taking, whether it leads to it or comes from it.&#34;

&gt; &#34;What matters isn&#39;t what a person has or doesn&#39;t have, it is what he or she is afraid of losing.&#34;

&gt; &#34;There&#39;s something respectable in losing a billion dollars--provided it is your own money.&#34;

&gt; &#34;Too high a rate of mutation prevents locking in the benefits from previous changes. Evolution and progress require some but not too frequent variation.&#34;

&gt; &#34;It is not easy to sell without some strong narrative. But for a real business, as opposed to a fundraising scheme, something that should survive on its own, business plans and funding work backward.&#34;

&gt; &#34;...the error continues because someone else is paying the price.&#34;

&gt; &#34;The main theological flaw in Pascal&#39;s wager is that belief cannot be a free option. It entails a symmetry between what you pay and what you receive.&#34;

&gt; &#34;To make money, you must first survive.&#34; -Warren Buffet

&gt; &#34;Never cross a river if it is on average four feet deep.&#34;
