&lt;p>The Resilience4j circuit breaker by default considers any exception thrown inside of the &lt;strong>Supplier&lt;/strong> as a failure. If over 50% of the calls are failures and the rolling window max size is met, then it will prevent any future calls from going through.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Configuring, Testing, and Using Circuit Breakers on Rest API calls with Resilience4j</title><link>https://www.nickolasfisher.com/blog/configuring-testing-and-using-circuit-breakers-on-rest-api-calls-with-resilience4j/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 May 2021 19:06:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nickolasfisher.com/blog/configuring-testing-and-using-circuit-breakers-on-rest-api-calls-with-resilience4j/</guid><description>&lt;p>The source code for what follows &lt;a href="https://github.com/nfisher23/java-failure-and-resilience">can be found on Github&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The circuit breaker pattern, popularized by Netflix [using Hystrix], exists for a couple of reasons, the most prominent being that it reduces load on a downstream service when it is not responding properly [presumably because it&amp;rsquo;s under duress]. By wrapping operations that might fail and get overloaded in a circuit breaker, we can prematurely prevent cascading failure and stop overloading those services.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to Retry API Requests in Java using Resilience4j</title><link>https://www.nickolasfisher.com/blog/how-to-retry-api-requests-in-java-using-resilience4j/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 May 2021 18:34:59 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nickolasfisher.com/blog/how-to-retry-api-requests-in-java-using-resilience4j/</guid><description>&lt;p>The source code for what follows &lt;a href="https://github.com/nfisher23/java-failure-and-resilience">can be found on Github&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you&amp;rsquo;re working with distributed systems, it is often the case that some clones of a service running can be slow to respond, while still others are functioning perfectly normally. Therefore, when you just hit a load balancer and the load balancer chooses a backend, it can sometimes be beneficial to retry the request. Other things like periodic and small database stalls or random GC stop-the-worlds are examples where retries can smooth the experience for the client of your service.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
