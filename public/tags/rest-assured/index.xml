&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/rest-assured/rest-assured/wiki/Usage">Rest Assured&lt;/a> is a library that makes it easy to write api based automated tests in java.

I found a nice way to do this with &lt;a href="https://github.com/rest-assured/rest-assured/wiki/Usage#filters">rest assured filters&lt;/a>, and I&amp;rsquo;m going to share that with you in this article.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
