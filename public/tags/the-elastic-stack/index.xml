&lt;p>In a previous post on &lt;a href="https://nickolasfisher.com/blog/How-to-Provision-Multiple-Logstash-Hosts-Using-Ansible">How to Provision Multiple Logstash Hosts Using Ansible&lt;/a>, we saw that provisioning logstash is pretty straightforward. However, what do we do with it after it&amp;rsquo;s been out there transforming messages this entire time? Given that elastic comes out with a new version of Logstash every fifteen or twenty minutes, a wise person would look to automate the upgrade process as soon as possible.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to Provision a Linux VM With Kibana Using Ansible</title><link>https://www.nickolasfisher.com/blog/how-to-provision-a-linux-vm-with-kibana-using-ansible/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Mar 2019 15:37:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nickolasfisher.com/blog/how-to-provision-a-linux-vm-with-kibana-using-ansible/</guid><description>&lt;p>The corresponding source code for this post is available &lt;a href="https://github.com/nfisher23/some-ansible-examples">on GitHub&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana">Kibana&lt;/a> is a fancy pants web application that tries to make data in Elasticsearch user-friendly. Rounding out the previous two posts on &lt;a href="https://nickolasfisher.com/blog/How-to-Provision-a-Multi-Node-Elasticsearch-Cluster-Using-Ansible">how to install an elasticsearch cluster&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://nickolasfisher.com/blog/How-to-Install-Multiple-Logstash-Hosts-Using-Ansible">how to install multiple logstash hosts&lt;/a>, I will now show you how to stack kibana on top of them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to Provision Multiple Logstash Hosts Using Ansible</title><link>https://www.nickolasfisher.com/blog/how-to-provision-multiple-logstash-hosts-using-ansible/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Mar 2019 23:33:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nickolasfisher.com/blog/how-to-provision-multiple-logstash-hosts-using-ansible/</guid><description>&lt;p>The source code for this post can be found &lt;a href="https://github.com/nfisher23/some-ansible-examples">on GitHub&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash">Logstash&lt;/a> primarily exists to extract useful information out of plain-text logs. Most applications have custom logs which are in whatever format the person writing them thought would look reasonable&amp;hellip;usually to a human, and not to a machine. While countless future developer hours would be preserved if everything were just in JSON, that is sadly not even remotely the case, and in particular it&amp;rsquo;s not the case for log files. Logstash aims to be the intermediary between the various log formats and Elasticsearch, which is the document database provided by Elastic as well.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to Provision a Multi Node Elasticsearch Cluster Using Ansible</title><link>https://www.nickolasfisher.com/blog/how-to-provision-a-multi-node-elasticsearch-cluster-using-ansible/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Mar 2019 23:15:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nickolasfisher.com/blog/how-to-provision-a-multi-node-elasticsearch-cluster-using-ansible/</guid><description>&lt;p>You can see the sample code for this tutorial &lt;a href="https://github.com/nfisher23/some-ansible-examples">on GitHub.&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch">Elasticsearch&lt;/a> is a distributed, NoSQL, document database, built on top of Lucene. There are so many things I could say about Elasticsearch, but instead I&amp;rsquo;ll focus on how to install a simple 3-node cluster with an Ansible role. The following example will not have any security baked into it, so it&amp;rsquo;s really just a starting point to get you up and running.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A VagrantFile for Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana (On Three Different Servers)</title><link>https://www.nickolasfisher.com/blog/a-vagrantfile-for-elasticsearch-logstash-and-kibana-on-three-different-servers/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Nov 2018 13:42:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.nickolasfisher.com/blog/a-vagrantfile-for-elasticsearch-logstash-and-kibana-on-three-different-servers/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.elastic.co/">Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana&lt;/a>, commonly referred to as ELK or the Elastic Stack, is a set of tools that can, well do a lot of things.
